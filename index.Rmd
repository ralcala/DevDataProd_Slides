## 1. Introduction

 <br>
>- Do methods in Machine Learning so really differ a lot among them?<br>
>- Complex methods beat simple methods? <br>
>- Can a simple dataset be enough to show these differences? <br>
>- Is pre-processing critical for the results final quality? <br>
<br>
<br>
>- A <em>Shiny</em> app will allow to quickly test several options to study how they affect a smple machine learning classifcation of a test dataset. <br>
<br>
At the same several performance metrics will be used and shown. Stay tuned!

## 2. Pre-processing & classification methods

How do data preparation and algorithms improve classificaion?, can we conclude something about using or not using them?

*** =left

Several preprocessing will be alowed:

- Raw values.
- Standarization: $\frac{x - s}{\mu}$, mean 0, SD 1.
- Normalization: $\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}$, range 0-1.
- PCA transform.

*** =right

A pletora of classifiers will be used:

- Discriminant analysis:
    - LDA (Linear).
    - QDA (Quadratic).
- SVM (Support Vector Machine).
- DT (Decission Tree).
- NB (Naïve Bayes).

## 3. Exploratory Data analysis (I): Summaries

*** =left

```{r eda1, echo = TRUE, comment = ""}
summary(iris[, 1:4])
colMeans(iris[, 1:4])
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, sd)
```

*** =right

<br>
<strong>Observations:</strong>

- The ranges for values, means and standard deviations (SD) are similar.
- Greatest mean is ~5x the lowest one.
- Greatest SD is 4x the lowest SD.
- No great difference between ranges, so transformations/pre-processing maybe not a great deal.
- Yet big enough so that differences should appear when using or not pre-processing.

## 4. Exploratory Data analysis (II): Correlations

*** =left

```{r pairs, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, comment = "", warning = FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

data(iris)

#pairs(iris[, 1:4], col = iris$Species)

ggpairs(iris, columns = 1:4, color = "Species", title = "Correlation among covariates by specie", lower = list(continuous = "smooth")) + theme_bw()
```

*** =right

<br>
<strong>Observations:</strong>

- There appear strong correlations between variables, even when splitting by species.
- Some pair of co-variates appear to separate quite well the 3 classes.
- A very good classification should be achieved.
- <span class="setosa">Setosa</span> specie should be the one with the least classification error.
- <span class="versicolor">Versicolor</span> and <span class="virginica">virginica</span> overlap the most in average.

## 5. Final notes

<br>
- The app will be developed with ShinyApps from RStudio.
<br>
<br>
- Will use the ShinyDashboard package to create better interfaces.
<br>
<br>
- Documentation in form of a a short guide/manual will be inserted in the same app.
<br>
<br>
- The app will be initially hostd at <a href="http://www.shinyapps.io/">www.shinyapps.io</a>, so there can be availability problems if the app goes too popular, xD.
